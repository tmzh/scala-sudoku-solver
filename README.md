## Introduction
A sudoku solver in Scala written in functional style. The algorithm is modeled around Norvig's (Sudoku solver solution)[https://norvig.com/sudoku.html] written in Python. The Python solution is neat and easy to follow. But it makes of mutable data structures and side effects. This project is an attempt to recreate the same login in functional style.
